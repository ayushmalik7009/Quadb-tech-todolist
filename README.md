# Quadb-tech-todolist
My name is Ayush Malik. First of all, thanks for giving me this opportunity. This project is a todo list app deployed at this link.
[Deployed LInk](https://ayushmaliktodolist.netlify.app/)

In this project, I used HTML, CSS, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and local storage.

To set up the project:

1. Run **npm install** to install the node_modules.
2. To run the project: Use the command **npm run dev** to start the development server.
Feel free to explore the app and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.
